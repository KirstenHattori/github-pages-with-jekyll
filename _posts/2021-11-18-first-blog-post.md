Markdown is the language of choice for the Git realm. 
=====================================================

so far, markdown seems like a fun syntax to write in
----------------------------------------------------

it is a little more straightforward and natural than <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.  for instance: 
* there are no {opening or closing} tags
* paragraphs are just written like you're writing in a text editor {a la notepad}
* <abbr title="line item">li</abbr> in a <abbr title="unordered">ul</abbr> are denoted with a single <abbr title="asterisk">*</abbr> followed by a space and there is no need to even mark the ul itself

I should really consider making a post for the steps to branch and commmit and make pull reuests {that i learned in the introduction to GitHub course i finished right before starting this one}

1. create a branch
  * select main in the bottom left of the vs code window
2. so to Source Control view
  * located in the left tool column of vs code
  * select Push from the ... menu
  * confirm the dialog box prompt to publish the branch
3. commit a file
  * in this local branch, make changes or additions to the codebase
4. stage the new file
  * back in source control view, click the + button next to the file
5. commit the change
  * type a commit messag in the text field and press ctrl+enter
6. push it
  * select Push from the ... menu again
