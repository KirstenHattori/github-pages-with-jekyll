Markdown is the language of choice for the Git realm. 
=====================================================

so far, markdown seems like a fun syntax to write in
----------------------------------------------------

it is a little more straightforward and natural than <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.  for instance: 
* there are no {opening or closing} tags
* paragraphs are just written like you're writing in a text editor {a la notepad}
* <abbr title="line item">li</abbr> in a <abbr title="unordered">ul</abbr> are denoted with a single <abbr title="asterisk">*</abbr> followed by a space and there is no need to even mark the ul itself

I should really consider making a post for the steps to branch and commmit and make pull reuests {that i learned in the introduction to GitHub course i finished right before starting this one}
